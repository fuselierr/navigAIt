This case study is hypothetical and based on publicly available information research by Geesehacks.  
It was developed for competition purposes only. 
 
A Note From the Authors 
 
Firstly, thank you for providing your time to participate in this case! We hope that you 
are as excited as us to get started. This case was written by and produced by Geesehack staff and 
in no way reflects the true situation of Sun Life. Please keep this in mind while completing the 
case.  
 
While we are not executives of Sun Life, we have drawn insight from past case 
competitions, hackathons, communication with Sun Life staff and even had work experience at 
Sun Life to design and perfect this case.  
 
We encourage the use of all tools available to you to find a solution to this case including 
but not limited to: all coding software, photoshop, AI (although we will remove points if AI has 
been used to a noticeably significant capacity and without creativity) and anything else that you 
may to aid you on your journey. 
 
If you run into any issues during the case, whether it be personal or case related, please 
do not hesitate to reach out to any of our staff. We will be in the area to assist you. Additionally 
for private inquiries, please reach out to our support staff (more information will be provided by 
the organizers regarding this). 
 
 Unlike many other hackathons, you will have to think of solutions that address the key 
root of the problem being asked, and then think of solutions to address that problem. Despite this 
limitation, we encourage uniqueness, flashy ideas and your pitch abilities to create the best 
solution so make sure that you are brainstorming the best solutions and keep your ideas and 
information private! Disputes between teams are up to the judgement of the organizers. 
 
If you were kind enough to read this far, we’ll give you a small hint on where we would 
start our research. ETFs are drastically increasing in popularity, especially among younger 
generations. Maybe consider what makes them so attractive over other tools such as mutual 
funds, bonds or derivatives? Are there any pain points with commonly used investments, for both 
companies and individuals?  Without further ado, we’ll let you get started! 
 
Good luck from the case writing team, Douglas, Shawn, Jonathan and Priota

Current Situation: 
 
 With Gen Z (1997 to 2012) and Gen Alpha (2010 to 2024) beginning to enter/complete 
higher education, they are now brought to a valuable question: How can we ensure that we are 
not only able to attract youth from being a client of Sun Life, while also ensuring we retain and 
engage them? Additionally, it is important for Sun Life to be providing value for its clients so 
how can we help Sun Life clients take care of their financial wellbeing? 
 
In today’s day and age, younger generations are beginning to exert their spending 
potential. With a current spending power of 860 billion dollars as of 2024 and potentially up to 
12 trillion dollars within the next 6 years, it is crucial for Sun Life to target this new generation. 
A couple of trends have been identified among youth. A digital presence is a must as current 
youth are considered to be incredibly tech-savvy. Social media is a dominating presence in the 
technical space and could open up marketing opportunities. Additionally, there has been an 
increased emphasis on the implementation of user-generated content (UGC) solutions. While not 
all great solutions need to play to one of these, or another trend, a sound marketing plan likely 
would determine the difference between success and failure.  
 
Time is running out as each year, Gen Z and Gen Alpha are one step closer to the adult 
stage of life. How and with what can we target these new potential clients in a way that ensures 
increases in capture rates, and loyalty while also providing value to this new demographic? 
Remember, your solution must not only be viable and built out but also needs to be defensible 
using real-world data and market data. (See the rubric in the appendix for more information)

A Brief History 
 
In 1865, Mathew Hamilton Gault created a new firm in Montreal with the goal of 
developing an insurance firm in Canada. Sun Life fell into some troubles with the Great 
Depression in the 1930s but used the recovery as a new chance to expand assets and grow. 
Despite facing a variety of global challenges, they managed to remain profitable and expand to

● Royal Bank of Canada: While not necessarily known for their insurance as well as they 
are known for being the largest commercial bank Canada (ranked 11th in the world by 
marker capitalization), they are still a major player in the insurance and financial 
industries. The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is one of Canada’s largest and oldest

noticed a trend with this>>. Established in 1864 as the third oldest big 5 bank behing 
Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, RBC offers a wide range of financial

companies.

Sun Life is looking for new ways to help continue serving its wide variety of customers 
better as well as new solutions to help the newer demographics, like Gen Z that are entering the 
workforce and the issues that uniquely face the younger generation.  
 
 
Products: 
As the largest financial services company in Canada, Sun Life offers a wide array of 
products and services such as Insurance, Investments, Financial Advising, and Asset 
Management. In addition, they have also rolled out a digital app to enhance and expedite the 
insurance process. Below is a more in depth description of each product: 
 
Insurance 
Sun Life Financial's insurance division offers a wide range of products designed to help 
individuals, families, and businesses achieve financial security. These products include life 
insurance (term, whole, and universal), health and dental insurance, critical illness insurance, 
disability insurance, and group benefits for businesses. 
 
The division focuses on providing tailored solutions to meet diverse client needs, 
supporting both short-term protection and long-term financial planning. Operating globally, Sun 
Life's insurance services are a key part of its mission to help clients achieve lifetime financial 
confidence and well-being. 
 
Perhaps what Sun Life is best known for, there are two main products within insurance 
that Sun Life focuses on: life insurance and health insurance. Life insurance provides a payment 
to the policy holder’s beneficiaries, ensuring financial security in the event of death. On the other 
hand, health insurance looks to protect the policyholder from the financial impact caused by 
illness, accidents, or disability. 
 
Investments 
Sun Life Financial's investments division focuses on providing a broad range of asset 
management and investment solutions to individuals, businesses, and institutions. Through its 
subsidiary, Sun Life Global Investments, and its majority-owned affiliate, MFS Investment 
Management, the division offers access to mutual funds, segregated funds, pension plans, and 
customized portfolio solutions. 
 
The division emphasizes sustainable investing, incorporating environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) factors into its strategies. Its goal is to help clients grow and protect their 
wealth while aligning with long-term financial objectives. Sun Life's investment offerings 
support retirement savings, income generation, and overall wealth management.

Financial Advising 
To help its clients navigate and plan for their financial future, Sun Life offers a variety of 
financial advising services through its force of advisors, agents, and consultants. This group of 
people aim to help Sun Life's customers navigate the future, prevent hard financial times and 
prepare for retirement. While the younger generations are often not yet planning for retirement, 
according to recent trends, Gen Z is taking a higher initiative to invest into their futures. In fact, 
according to a recent study by TD, Gen Z is out-investing all other generations with 68% of 
respondents reporting saving for their future, thus proving the need to target this demographic 
with financial products. In addition, there are many financial planning tools offered through the 
company’s app that are useful for aiding a customer's plan for their future. We would advise 
taking a brief look through this page and exploring the types of readily available content that Sun 
Life has to offer (it can be found both on the app store and google play store). The goal of these 
services is to assist people in reaching their financial goals by selecting the right mix of 
investment and insurance products allowing them to navigate financial downturn while 
accumulating more wealth as time progresses.  
 
 
Asset Management 
Sun Life Financial Inc. is Canada's largest asset manager, overseeing approximately 
$1.52 trillion in assets as of September 30, 2024.  Its asset management operations are primarily 
conducted through two subsidiaries: 
 
1. MFS Investment Management: Founded a century ago, MFS serves individual and 
institutional investors globally. Despite managing substantial assets, MFS has faced net outflows 
due to market trends favoring high-growth tech stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In 
response, MFS plans to launch five actively managed ETFs in December 2024 to align with 
investor preferences.  
 
2. SLC Management: This division caters to institutional clients worldwide, offering 
expertise in fixed income, liability-driven investing, and alternative asset classes, including real 
estate and infrastructure equity. SLC Management comprises four specialty managers: 
 
● SLC Fixed Income: One of North America's largest investment-grade fixed income 
investors. 
● BentallGreenOak: A global real estate investment management advisor. 
● InfraRed: An international investment manager focused on infrastructure. 
● Crescent Capital Group: A global alternative credit investment manager specializing in 
various credit strategies.

Sun Life's asset management business continues to adapt to market dynamics, expanding 
its product offerings and maintaining a strong global presence. 
 
Sun Life Digital Services 
Available online or via their mobile app, the Sun Life’s digital services allow clients to 
access information regarding their policies, their investments, or book meetings with advisors. In 
addition, as mentioned before the app also contains various financial planning tools such as a 
retirement calculator.  
 
External Environment 
Sun Life Financial operates in a highly competitive and dynamic financial services and 
insurance industry, facing challenges from well-established players and emerging disruptors. Its 
competitors span across life insurance, wealth management, and retirement services, both within 
Canada and internationally. 
 
Key Domestic Competitors 
As mentioned in the competition section, in the Canadian market, Sun Life’s primary 
competitors include Manulife Financial, Great-West Lifeco, and Industrial Alliance. Manulife, 
Canada’s largest insurer, offers a wide range of financial services, including life insurance, 
wealth management, and retirement solutions, often mirroring Sun Life’s portfolio. Manulife’s 
strong global presence, especially in Asia, positions it as a formidable competitor in markets that 
Sun Life is also targeting for growth. Similarly, Great-West Lifeco has diversified its offerings 
through subsidiaries like Canada Life and Putnam Investments, focusing on group insurance, 
asset management, and retirement products. Industrial Alliance, while smaller, competes through 
its regional focus and personalized service offerings, appealing to niche markets in Canada.  
 
Global Competitors 
On the global stage, Sun Life competes with multinational giants like Prudential 
Financial, MetLife, and AIA Group. Prudential and MetLife dominate the U.S. insurance market 
and have extensive operations in Europe and Asia, leveraging their scale and brand recognition. 
These firms also invest heavily in technology and alternative asset management, similar to Sun 
Life’s recent strategies. AIA Group, based in Hong Kong, has a commanding presence in Asia, 
where Sun Life is focusing much of its expansion efforts. AIA’s deep market knowledge and 
local partnerships give it a competitive advantage in the region. 
 
Emerging Threats 
Sun Life also faces growing competition from InsurTech startups and digital-first 
companies entering the insurance and wealth management sectors. Firms like Lemonade and 
Policygenius are disrupting traditional models with data-driven algorithms, AI-powered 
platforms, and customer-centric services. These companies appeal particularly to younger, 
Douglas Tisdale, Shawn Gan, Jonathan Wang, Priota Hassan 

A Brighter Future for the Generation of Tomorrow, Geesehack 2025              9 
tech-savvy demographics who value convenience and transparency. In this competitive 
environment, What can Sun Life look into in order to maximize its reach with Gen Z as they 
continue to enter the workforce? 
 
Other Considerations 
With the growth of digital currencies since 2008, and other alternative currencies, new 
technologies have arised that have found their place within the insurance and wealth 
management industry. For example, Sun Life partnered with blockchain technology SecuredKey 
in  2018 to help make the verification process for users quicker and faster. With technologies 
rising at every corner, there are always both opportunities and threats to explore and consider for 
Sun Life. Consider what unexplored applications of both popular and niche technologies there 
are. 
 
Conclusion 
Sun Life is looking to capture new audiences, and you and your team are the key to new 
innovation. Whether this be a new avenue for growth, an expansion of a current offering, a 
quality of life function or anything that your mind can come up with, we are looking for you to 
build a solution to the new youth demographic. How should Sun Life proceed to ensure success 
for the future?
